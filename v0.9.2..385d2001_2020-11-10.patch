-It is also not possible to offer this additional functionality on top

-very likely convey even more functionality.  So it might be a good idea
-to change to GNU `gettext' as soon as possible.

 only have to set the `LANG' environment variable to the appropriate

 suppose that you speak German and live in Germany.  At the shell

    In the `LANGUAGE' environment variable, but not in the `LANG'
 environment variable, `LL_CC' combinations can be abbreviated as `LL'
 to denote the language's main dialect.  For example, `de' is equivalent
 to `de_DE' (German as spoken in Germany), and `pt' to `pt_PT'
 (Portuguese as spoken in Portugal) in this context.
 
-Translating Teams
-=================
+1.3 Translating Teams
+=====================
 
 For the Free Translation Project to be a success, we need interested
 people who like their own language and write it well, and who are also
 able to synergize with other translators speaking the same language.
 Each translation team has its own mailing list.  The up-to-date list of
 teams can be found at the Free Translation Project's homepage,
